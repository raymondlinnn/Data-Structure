 Einstein was disappointed at humanity. He decided to form his own government. He united some of the best and smartest scientist, with a bunch of closed friend who controls the military power. They formed a secret government inside the U.S government and waited for the right timing to overthrow the government, and they succeeded. Einstein was elected as the president. They created a utopia world where they united the whole world as one country.
