After huge effort and money spent in the project, with another heroic figure Robert Oppenheimer, they finally built the first atomic bomb in the world. Then they dropped two atomic bombs in the battle with Japan. That was the last straw to win the World War 2. The Axis powers were terrified by such power and surrendered with no condition. Einstein was both happy and sad about the result: the war was finally over, but the atomic bomb was used twice in the battle, and a lot of people were killed. That was something he had to live with his whole life. He continued studies, and peacefully gone at 18 April, 1955. He was remembered as one of the greatest scientist who changed the world.
