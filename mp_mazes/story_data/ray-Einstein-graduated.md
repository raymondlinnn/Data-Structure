Einstein was eventually able to gain admission into the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, specifically due to his superb mathematics and physics scores on the entrance exam. He later renounced his German citizenship and became a Swiss citizen at the dawn of the new century. He couldn't find an academic position at that time, but he found a steady work as a clerk in a Swiss patent office. He had more time to further explore ideas and  cemented his theorems on what would be known as the principle of relativity. Later, he published papers about relativity and the famous formula E = MC2.
He found out his theories indirectly helped the invention of the nuclear bomb, and he was so sad about it, wondering why humanity turns this into such a powerful weapon. He had three options.

# ray-Einstein-rick
